Questions + Concerns



When the bee hits a wall, does it bounce off, stick on the wall, or reset to a certain position? If it bounces off, how far does it bounce off? 

Is there a cooldown for losing time when running into the wall? If you stick to the wall and there’s no cooldown, do you just instantly lose all your time?

How fast do the people and the bee move?

Some of the level designs and person placements are near impossible to pass and require a time window that only lasts a fraction of a section, which is made even harder considering you can’t stop moving or stop yourself on the walls.

For some of the later levels, 80% of each maze is completely useless. Some levels (like level 2) have a definitive path from beginning to end that doesn’t even allow for any “wrong turns” because there’s no turns to make before you hit the exit.

The later mazes are quite big for the time limit of 1:30. Visibility could suffer because of how small the bee becomes.


Suggestions

Increase the roaming range of the humans to allow for more windows of opportunity for the bee to pass through

Remove the mechanic of losing time when running into walls (not everyone is a god at precision platforming/maneuvering)

Non constant movement
